4.1. Cores

As everything nontrivial in Hoon is a core, it behooves us to delve deeply into what cores are, their varieties and behaviors, and their conversions and interoperabilities.

4.1.1. Genericity

Hoon distinguishes cores by genericity as _dry_ or _wet_ cores.

https://urbit.org/docs/reference/hoon-expressions/advanced/

Compare the Nock generated from two otherwise-identical gates, one wet, one dry.

A dry gate:

```hoon
> !=(|=(a=@ (add a 2)))
[8 [1 0] [1 8 [9 36 0 8.191] 9 2 10 [6 [0 14] 7 [0 3] 1 2] 0 2] 0 1]
```

A wet gate:

```hoon
> !=(|*(a=@ (add a 2)))
[8 [1 0] [1 8 [9 36 0 8.191] 9 2 10 [6 [0 14] 7 [0 3] 1 2] 0 2] 0 1]
```

Those both look the same in Nock, so what's the difference?  Genericity is a Hoon concept, and has to do with how the sample of a gate is treated.

4.1.2. Variance

> There are four kinds of cores: gold (invariant payload), iron (contravariant sample), zinc (covariant sample), and lead (bivariant sample). Information about the kind of core is tracked by the Hoon type system.

Type variance is frequently applied in object-oriented programming to explain how methods and inheritance relate.  For Hoon, therefore, it is natural that variance would instead describe core behavior.

Programmers new to Hoon typically find the variance model to be doubly confusing because of the metal labels affixed to each type.  We provide these but constantly reiterate the relevant variance.

Each core has a `[battery payload]`, with the `payload` consisting of `[sample context]`.  `battery` nesting, as we saw with genericity, is fairly straightforward, but `payload` matching can be much more involved.

Lead cores have bivariant `sample`s.  Typically consider a pathological case, bivariance requires that the
information lost

Zinc cores have covariant `sample`s.  This is perhaps the most intuitive form of nesting, describing how every `Square` is a `Quadrilateral`
read-only

Iron cores have contravariant `sample`s.
write-only `sample`, opaque `context`

Gold cores have invariant payloads (both `[sample context]`).  Since most cores are gold cores,
