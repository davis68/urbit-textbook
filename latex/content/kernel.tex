\section{Arvo}
\labsec{arvo}

Arvo is essentially an event handler which can coordinate and dispatch messages between vanes as well as emit \unix~events to the underlying (presumed Unix-compatible) host OS.  Arvo does not carry out several tasks specific to the machine hardware, such as memory allocation, system thread management, and hardware- or firmware-level operations.  These are left to the king and serf, or the daemon processes which together run Arvo.  Collectively, the system-level instrumentation of Arvo is described in Chapter~\ref{support}.

\section[\ames]{\ames, A Network}
\labsec{ames}

In a sense, \ames~is the operative definition of an urbit on the network.  That is, from outside of one's own urbit, the only specification that must be hewed to is that \ames~behaves a certain way in response to events.

\ames~implements a system expecting—and delivering—guaranteed one-time delivery.  This derives from an observation by \citeauthor{Yarvin2016}~in the Whitepaper:  "bus v. commands whatever"

\section[\behn]{\behn, A Timer}
\labsec{behn}

\behn~is a simple vane that promises to emit events after—but never before—their timestamp.  This guarantee

As the shortest vane, we commend \behn~to the student as an excellent subject for a first dive into the structure of a vane.

\behn~maintains an event handler and a state.

Any task may have one of the following states:

\begin{lstlisting}
%born  born:event-core
%rest  (rest:event-core date=p.task)
%drip  (drip:event-core move=p.task)
%huck  (huck:event-core syn.task)
%trim  trim:event-core
%vega  vega:event-core
%wait  (wait:event-core date=p.task)
%wake  (wake:event-core error=~)
\end{lstlisting}
