how do you generate this

L
5:02 PM
just run your urbit with urbit -j piername
for a few minutes
then look in .urb/put/trace folder
you should have like 100mb of json in there
then just move all the json out to your desktop or something
and then open the json files in chrome://tracing in Chrome or Brave
